      <h2>Thimphu-the Capital of Bhutan</h2>
      <br><p>Thimphu is an unusual capital city in the world. Itâ€™s a small town with a population of little over a hundred thousand. The entire district of Thimphu has a population of about 150 thousand. The city became the capital of Bhutan in 1961. Today it is a bustling town on the bank of the Thimphu Chu (the Chu means River) and is set gloriously in the hills of Thimphu valley. Thimphu is home to the revered Bhutanese Royal Family, the Royal Govt. and Judiciary and to several foreign missions and development projects.<br></p>

      <h2>Paro</h2>
      <p>Paro, a beautiful valley in Bhutan, is one of the most attractive tourist destinations in this mountainous country.

      One of the most beautiful of Bhutan's valleys, it was also historically the centre of two of the most important trade routes to Tibet.

      Today the new road to Phuentsholing on the Indian border runs through the valley, amid a patchwork of rice, paddies, wheat fields, trout-filled streams, and scattered settlements.

      Here the Paro Chu (Chu means River) flows south from its watershed in the Chomolahri range. Above it in a rocky outcrop of the sleepy hillside stands the Paro Dzong, at an altitude of just over 7000 feet, overlooking both sides of the valley this dzong was historically one of Bhutan's strongest and most strategic fortresses. Before the rebuilding of the Tashi Chho Dzong at Thimphu, it was also the seat of the National Assembly.</p>

      <h2>Phuentsholing</h2>
      <p>The small modern town of Phuentsholing in the south is the gateway to Bhutan. Headquarters of the Bank of Bhutan and the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan on top of a low hill with a small Gumpha or public temple at nearby Kharbandi, reconstructed by Queen Phuentsholing Chhoden, grandmother of the present king, looks out over the town and the surrounding plains.

      The Amo Chuu, commonly known as the Torsha River, is a favourite spot for fishermen and picnickers. The jungles that lie close by teeming with wild animals and birds, for here the traveller is in the heart of Bhutan's subtropical southern zone.

      From Phuentsholing the road winds north, over the southern foothills, through lush forested valleys and around the rigged north-south ridges of the inner of Thimphu and Paro. Hairpin corners on this breathtaking six-hour drive are, to reassure the traveller, marked with tall, colourful sculptures of the Tashi Tagye, the eight auspicious signs of Buddhism.

      <h2>Trongsa</h2>
      <p>In the centre of Bhutan and four hours by drive from Wangdue Phodrang, Trongsa offers a welcome rest to travellers. The approach to the town involves a trip around Trongsa valley. A vantage point from the opposite side of the valley, still 14 km from town, provides an exciting view of the Dzong and the town.

     The secular and religious centre, the Dzong, dominates the horizon, dwarfing the surrounding buildings.

     The royal family's ancestral home is Trongsa. Both his majesty king Ugyen Wangchuk, the Penlop of Trongsa, who was elected the country's first hereditary monarch, and his successor king Jigme Wangchuk, ruled the country from Trongsa's ancient Dzong. The crown prince of Bhutan normally holds the position of the Trongsa Penlop prior to ascending to the throne - the present king continued this tradition as he appointed Penlop in 1972 shortly before he ascended the Throne of Bhutan.</p>
